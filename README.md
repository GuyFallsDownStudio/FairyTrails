# Fairy Trails

_Fairy Trails_ is an app for small groups of visitors to [Minnetrista](http://minnetrista.net)&mdash;a
cultural center, museum, and gathering place in Muncie, Indiana.
Only one person needs to download the app from the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store.
Through the app, the group will explore Minnetrista's campus and encounter playful fairies.

## Background
_Fairy Trails_ was created by a multidisciplinary team of undergraduate students at [Ball
State University](https://bsu.edu) in Spring 2018.
The team formed _Guy Falls Down Studio_ and created this
game as part of an [Immersive Learning](http://bsu.edu/immersive) experience.
